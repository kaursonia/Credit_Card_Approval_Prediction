# Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction

Project Overview
The aim of the project id to develop a machine learning model to predict credit card approval and evaluate its impact on the banking sector.
Performed data pre-processing and exploration using Python, handled missing values and dealt with extreme outliers using relevant methods. Utilised matplotlib and seaborn libraries for detailed visualisation.
The cleaned dataset was transferred to MySQL and various queries are performed.
Performed data scaling, trained multiple machine learning models using scikit-learn in Python, and evaluated their performance for predicting credit card approval, comparing metrics and plotting results.
